This is a program to compute and identify CIFAR 10 images. CIFAR or Canadian Institute For Advanced Research
provides 10 different categories of images in it. It has 60K of 32x32 images wherein 50k are for training and 
10k are for test. We plan on building an image classifier using Tensorflow's Keras api
